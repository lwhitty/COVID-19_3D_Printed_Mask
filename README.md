<h1 id="covid-19-montana-3d-printed-mask">COVID-19 Montana 3D Printed Mask</h1>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital staff and the general public. I’ve been experimenting with printing different 3D mask designs, but most of them had to be custom formed after printing or just didn’t work. Then, I found the following short video by Dr. Dusty Richardson, MD on the Montana Mask:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nArDE44miz0">Montana Mask Walkthrough</a></p>
<p>That video let me to this website, which contains additional info about the masks and how to make them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.billingsclinic.com/foundation/3d-printed-surgical-mask/">Billings Clinic 3D Printed Surgical Mask</a></p>
<p>The URLs on that website to download the STL files required for 3D printing didn’t resolve, but I was able to find them elsewhere and included them <a href="https://github.com/lwhitty/COVID-19_Montana_3D_Printed_Mask/blob/master/n95-montana-mask.zip">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="d-printer-settings">3D Printer Settings</h1>
<p>I used 3D Simplify and the following settings to print these masks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filament Type: PLA</li>
<li>Infill: 0.25</li>
<li>Layer Height: 0.1 mm</li>
<li>Rotate the mask image so that the front lies plat on the printing bed</li>
<li>No supports</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the 3D Simplify factory file modified with the above settings <a href="https://github.com/lwhitty/COVID-19_Montana_3D_Printed_Mask/blob/master/MontanaMasks.factory">here</a></p>

<h1 id="ready-to-print-x3g-files">Ready to Print x3g Files</h1>
<p>If you have a Makerbot dual extruder or compatible printer, I’ve created ready to print x3g files that include both the mask and the filter holder. I also scaled down the original size mask (large - 100%) to a medium size (95%) and small size (90%). You can place the appropriate x3g file directly on an SD card and print - no computer required:</p>

<h1 id="installing-the-filtration-material">Installing the Filtration Material</h1>
<p>Most suppliers of N95 filtration material such as <a href="https://www.flowmarkhightech.com/">this one</a> are out of stock. I’m using blue shop towels for testing, and I also ordered some <a href="https://www.filtrete.com/3M/en_US/filtrete/about-us/the-right-filter-for-you/">3M Filtrete</a> furnace filters that are meant for filtering out bacteria and viruses, and I’m hoping the material from these filters can be used in the masks. Each of these furnace filters should provide enough filtration material for ~75 mask replacement filters. They won’t arrive for another week, so I’ll update this when they come in.Cut the filtration material to the following size to use with the mask:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large:</strong> 2.75" x 2.75"</li>
<li><strong>Medum:</strong> 2.6" x 2.6"</li>
<li><strong>Small:</strong> 2.5" x 2.5"</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installing-the-elastic-straps">Installing the Elastic Straps</h1>
<p>Elastic material is hard to come by. I used a woman’s headband for my test masks. Still looking for a better solution. I ordered some narrow latex surgical tubing which will arrive in a week, and will test that when it comes in.</p>
<h1 id="testing-and-improving-the-seal">Testing and Improving the Seal</h1>
<p>You can test the seal by removing the filter, putting the mask on, sealing the opening by holding your hand over it, and trying to breath in and out to see how much air enters or escapes. With the large mask, I have a pretty good seal. I tried putting some silicon weather striping along the edge of the mask, and it might slightly improve the seal, but it’s hard to tell and it doesn’t stay in place. I think it might be too much to expect a 100% seal with this mask. When the small diameter latex surgical tubing (mentioned above) arrives. I’ll try taking a piece, slit it down the length of the tube, and will place it over the mask edge to see if it improves the seal.</p>
