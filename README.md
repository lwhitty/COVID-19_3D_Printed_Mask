COVID-19_3D_Printed_Mask
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment
(PPE) for hospital staff as well as the general public. I've been experimenting with printing different 3D mask designs, but most of them had to be custom formed after printing or just didn't work. 

What materials and settings are needed?
 3D printer
o Recommended infill = 0.25
o Layer Height = 0.1 mm or less
o Different printer models and settings create variation in mask production times;
therefore, we are unable to provide further detailed specifications for settings.
 PLA or ABS filament
o All colors accepted
 Mask size
o 100% scale is recommended and is a universal size
